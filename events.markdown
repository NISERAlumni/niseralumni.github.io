We can't forget them. 
<br>
<br>
Ever.
<br>
<br>
They were the ones who made our stay at the campus easier. 
<br>
<br>
They were the ones who helped us cope up with the academics. 
<br>
<br>
And they were the ones who wished us a prosperous future ahead.
<br>
<br>
Here are a few snapshots of our reunions. These photos, although frozen in time, carry innumerable moments of happiness and joy.
